demo/setup.sh is under reconstruction and does not run as-is.

The --hash / --shadow drift subsystem it seeds was removed in the core
re-architecture; staleness is now per-section conflicts[] + last-updated dates.

For a working demo:
  • Interactive playground:  npm run playground     (see playground/README.md)
  • Resolve the seeded bundles directly:
      node resolver.mjs --manifest layers.json --concept decisions/primary-db
NOTE
exit 1
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Seeds the three curated OKF layer bundles for the demo and bakes the stale
# shadow (Team's Language exemption recorded against the Company base BEFORE the
# org tightened the standard). Idempotent: wipes and recreates demo/layers/.
# Manifests are committed (relative paths) and are NOT regenerated here.

## Language and Framework {#language}

Spring Boot with Java 21. The standard for all new services org-wide.

## Secrets and Auth {#secrets}

Services authenticate via company SSO and read secrets from the company vault. No service-local credential stores.

## Security and Compliance {#security}

PII is encrypted at rest and in transit. Follow the company data-retention policy for all stored records.

## Language and Framework {#language}

Scala 2.13 with Spark Structured Streaming for pipelines; Java 17 for remaining legacy services. We do not use Spring Boot — our workloads are streaming/batch, not request/response.

## Enforcement {#enforcement}

As of 2026-06, new services must pass the Spring Boot / Java 21 conformance check in company CI. Existing exemptions must be re-confirmed.
