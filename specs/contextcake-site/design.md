# ContextCake Site — Design

**Date:** 2026-07-02
**Status:** Approved shape (from planning session) — scaffold committed, build handed off to agents
**Spec:** `specs/contextcake-site/spec.md`
**Workflow:** Requirements-first

---

## 1. The one insight the site must land

> What agents read is a **composite**, assembled **section-by-section** across stacked
> layers — higher layer wins per section, everything else inherited, disagreements
> surfaced with dates. Not whole-document replacement.

Every page serves this. The 2026-06-24 viz brainstorm review established the failure modes
to avoid: never show a collapse-to-single-node (reads as winner-takes-all), never bury
provenance behind a click, never model layers as a strict linear stack in interactive
demos (membership is a DAG).

## 2. Brand system — "provenance stripes"

Precision instrument with one warm joke. The cake metaphor is expressed through
**stratified color only** — no cake illustrations, no cute mascot. The layer colors carry
product semantics and must mean the same thing on every surface (hero, docs code samples,
diagrams, OG images).

### Tokens (`site/src/styles/tokens.css` — single source of truth)

> **Amended 2026-07-07:** this table now records the *shipped* `tokens.css` values —
> the palette drifted warm during the two /impeccable critique rounds and is ratified
> as canon (UI-revamp decision D4). Console and playground adopt the same layer-color
> semantics. The pre-launch slate/indigo values are superseded.

| Token | Value | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `--cc-canvas` | `#10110f` | page background (dark-first, warm near-black) |
| `--cc-surface` | `rgba(30,31,28,0.78)` | cards, code blocks (translucent) |
| `--cc-surface-solid` | `#1e1f1c` | opaque surface |
| `--cc-surface-raised` | `#23241f` | raised panels |
| `--cc-surface-soft` | `rgba(243,239,230,0.055)` | faint fill |
| `--cc-border` / `--cc-border-strong` | `rgba(235,226,207,0.11)` / `0.2` | hairlines |
| `--cc-text` | `#f3efe6` | primary text (warm bone) |
| `--cc-text-body` | `#d2ccc0` | body text |
| `--cc-text-muted` | `#a9a296` | secondary (large sizes / labels only) |
| `--cc-text-faint` | `#80796f` | faint / disabled |
| `--cc-layer-personal` | `#d9ab53` | Personal stratum (amber, level 3, top) |
| `--cc-layer-team` | `#8dc3a8` | Team stratum (sage-teal, level 2) |
| `--cc-layer-company` | `#8bbad1` | Company stratum (blue, level 0, base) |
| `--cc-conflict` | `#e07a56` | conflict/dissent accent — sparing |
| `--cc-cta` / `--cc-cta-hover` | `#e8e0d0` / `#f3efe6` | primary CTA (bone, `--cc-on-cta` `#11130f`) |
| `--cc-radius-sm…xl` | `10 / 16 / 22 / 30px` | shape scale |
| `--cc-transition` | `200ms cubic-bezier(0.16,1,0.3,1)` | motion |

Light mode is required for docs (Starlight default toggle); marketing pages may stay
dark-only. Amber-on-dark and all text pairs must pass 4.5:1 — verify, don't assume.

### Logo

Three stacked strata (personal/team/company colors, top to bottom), slightly offset —
a minimal sediment/cake-slice mark. Renders as inline SVG. Favicon = the mark alone.

### Typography

- **Headings / labels / body:** Bricolage Grotesque — a single humanist-grotesque
  family carrying the type system with weight contrast (400–700).
- **Code, data, provenance labels:** JetBrains Mono (400–700) — monospace *only*
  where it is meaningful (resolved output, CLI, `layer · date`), never as a
  "technical" costume.
- Self-hosted via `@fontsource/*` packages — **no Google Fonts CDN in production**.
- Large type (hero ≥ 48px), 1.5–1.75 body line-height, 65–75 ch measure in docs prose.

> **Amended 2026-07-03 (design critique).** The type system moved off
> JetBrains-Mono-headings + IBM Plex Sans — the saturated "developer tool = mono"
> reflex lane — to Bricolage Grotesque. Mono is retained strictly for code/data.
> The provenance stripes and layer colors are unchanged: they remain the brand's
> distinctive element, and monospace now *contrasts* prose (human) against
> resolved data (machine) instead of flattening everything into code.

### Voice

The README's voice is the brand voice: declarative, technical, zero filler.
Tagline: **"Conflicts surfaced, not hidden."**
Hero headline candidates: "Every layer of what your team knows — one effective view." /
"Team knowledge, resolved."

### Motion

200–300 ms micro-interactions, color-shift hovers (no layout-shifting scale), scroll-snap
acceptable on marketing sections. Every animation has a `prefers-reduced-motion` static
equivalent.

## 3. Site architecture

```
/            Homepage (custom Astro page, dark marketing)
/docs/*      Starlight docs shell
/demo        Full-page interactive cascade demo (Phase 5)
/install     Install & setup (custom page; content gated on distribution decision)
/changelog   Generated from GitHub releases at build time
/404         In-brand
```

## 4. Homepage — section order

1. **Hero** — headline, subhead, `npx contextcake` copy box, CTAs (Get started → /docs,
   GitHub), cascade visual. Launch state: static banded composite (real resolver output,
   bands striped by layer color, provenance labels + dates on each band, one band showing
   a `conflicts[]` chip). Phase 5 upgrades it to the animated stack→column→composite.
2. **Problem** — three beats: knowledge scattered; agents read stale/contradictory docs;
   overwriting loses the dissent.
3. **How it works** — Stack / Resolve / Serve, one stratum color each.
4. **Live demo strip** — embedded mini resolve view → links to /demo. (Phase 5; omit until then.)
5. **Feature grid** — the seven features from spec AC.
6. **For agents** — MCP tool table + a real `read_file` JSON response showing
   `contributors`, per-section `sourceLayer`, `conflicts[]`.
7. **Quickstart** — the 5-command path from README, then footer.

## 5. Docs information architecture

Sidebar order = reading order. Sources named per page; port and correct, don't invent.

| Page | Source material |
|---|---|
| **Getting Started** | |
| Installation | README Quick start + distribution decision |
| Your first cascade (5 min) | README layer-cake example, `playground/demo-layers/` |
| Connect an agent (MCP) | README MCP tools + `mcp-server.mjs` flags |
| **Concepts** | |
| The layer cake | README + core design.md §1–3 |
| OKF bundles | README `layers.json` shape + OKF link |
| Merge semantics | README override table + core design.md |
| Conflicts & provenance | README `read_file` description; "surfaced, not hidden" |
| The trust boundary | CLAUDE.md gotcha — honest, prominent |
| **Guides** | |
| Playground tour | `playground/README.md` (near-verbatim port) |
| Foreign MCP sources | README + `examples/mock-context-source.mjs` |
| The capture write path | README write path + `ingest.mjs`/`write.mjs` |
| Promoting concepts | `promote.mjs` |
| **Reference** | |
| `layers.json` manifest | README + `sources/index.mjs` |
| CLI | flags of `resolver.mjs`, `ingest.mjs`, `write.mjs`, `promote.mjs`, `mcp-server.mjs` |
| MCP tools | README table + actual response shapes from `mcp-server.mjs` |
| Override syntax | README override table |

**Correctness rule:** reference pages are written against current source, not against
`docs/architecture.md` (partially superseded). Anything mentioning `--hash`, `--shadow`,
`override: exception`, Group layer, or recency tiebreak is stale — those subsystems were
removed in the core re-arch.

## 6. Tech stack

- **Astro + Starlight**, static output (`site/` in this repo). Docs shell, search, dark
  mode come free; marketing pages are custom Astro pages with scoped styles.
- **No Tailwind.** Styling = `tokens.css` custom properties + Astro scoped CSS. Keeps the
  dependency list short, consistent with project ethos.
- **Icons:** Lucide, inlined as SVG (no icon-font, no emoji-as-icon).
- **Hero/demo viz:** vanilla JS + SVG/canvas island. No three.js unless /demo genuinely
  needs it (decide in Phase 5; occlusion risk noted in the brainstorm applies to /demo).
- **Demo data seam:** `site/scripts/build-demo-data.mjs` enumerates concepts in
  `playground/demo-layers/` (via the manifest) and calls the resolver per concept →
  `site/src/data/demo-cascade.json`, run as a `prebuild` step. `resolver.mjs --concept`
  already emits JSON; only the enumeration wrapper is new.
- **Changelog:** build-time fetch of GitHub releases (graceful empty state while none).
- **Engine stays dependency-free** — all site deps live in `site/package.json` only.

## 7. Deployment

Cloudflare Pages, build root `site/`, `npm run build` → `site/dist`.
Preview: push to main (`/deploy-preview`). Production: GitHub release (`/go-live`) →
**contextcake.com** (registered 2026-07-02; the only TLD owned — .dev/.ai were available
but not purchased). No secrets in the build; the GitHub-releases fetch is
unauthenticated (private repo → skipped/empty until visibility resolves).

## 8. Build phases

| Phase | Deliverable | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Decisions (visibility, distribution, domain) | domain: **contextcake.com** · distribution: **versioned release archive first; source checkout secondary** |
| 2 | Brand kit: logo SVG, tokens.css, OG template | scaffold has tokens; logo TODO |
| 3 | Scaffold + homepage (static hero) | scaffold committed; homepage = agent task |
| 4 | Docs port (all §5 pages) + `/doc-reviewer` pass | agent task |
| 5 | Animated hero + /demo + demo-data seam | agent task (independent of 4) |
| 6 | Launch pass: OG images, a11y audit, responsive 375/768/1024/1440, linkcheck, `/go-live` | agent task |

## 9. Agent handoff — completeness

### Commands

```bash
cd site
npm install          # once
npm run dev          # http://localhost:4321
npm run build        # static build → dist/ (the CI gate; must exit 0)
npm run preview      # serve the built output
```

Engine tests are unaffected by site work; root `npm test` must still pass if any engine
file is touched (only `site/scripts/build-demo-data.mjs` should read engine code, and
only read).

### Testing

- Gate: `npm run build` exits 0 (includes Starlight's internal link validation).
- Add `astro check` if/when TS components appear.
- Visual verification: dev server + browser at 375/768/1024/1440 before calling a page done.

### Project structure

```
site/
├── astro.config.mjs        # Starlight config: title, sidebar, customCss
├── package.json            # site-only deps
├── scripts/
│   └── build-demo-data.mjs # Phase 5: resolver → demo-cascade.json
├── public/                 # favicon, OG images, robots.txt
└── src/
    ├── components/         # Hero.astro, StrataMark.astro, CopyCommand.astro, …
    ├── data/               # demo-cascade.json (generated; gitignored)
    ├── pages/              # index.astro, install.astro, demo.astro, changelog.astro
    ├── styles/tokens.css   # THE design tokens — single source of truth
    └── content/docs/docs/  # Starlight content → /docs/* routes
```

### Code style

- Astro components with scoped `<style>`; colors/fonts ONLY via `var(--cc-*)` tokens —
  no hard-coded hex outside `tokens.css`.
- Content in Markdown/MDX; component logic in vanilla TS/JS; match existing file naming
  (kebab-case files, PascalCase components).
- Docs prose voice = README voice. Sentence-case headings. Code samples must be runnable
  as written.

### Git workflow

- Branch from `main` (`c/<name>` convention), conventional commits
  (`feat(site):`, `docs(site):`), PR to `main`, squash merge.
- Plans/checklists never committed (`docs/plans/` is gitignored territory);
  spec + design.md are the committed artifacts.

### Boundaries

- ✅ **Always:** run `npm run build` in `site/` before any commit; keep all site
  dependencies inside `site/package.json`; use tokens for every color; provide
  reduced-motion fallbacks; self-host every asset.
- ⚠️ **Ask first:** adding dependencies beyond the scaffold set (Astro, Starlight,
  @fontsource, Lucide); changing brand tokens or the layer-color semantics; modifying any
  engine file; publishing anything to npm; changing repo visibility settings.
- 🚫 **Never:** commit secrets or API keys; commit `layers.json` or generated data
  (`site/src/data/*.json`, `site/dist/`); add third-party CDN/analytics/tracking; write
  install instructions that contradict the unresolved distribution decision as if final;
  force-push or push to `main`.

## 10. Self-verification (for build agents)

After completing any phase: **compare your output against `spec.md` and list any
acceptance criteria not addressed.** Do this before declaring the phase done.

## 11. Build notes — page-by-page (added 2026-07-02 for the agent build)

Everything below is verified against the engine as of this commit. Do not re-derive;
do not invent copy where approved copy is given.

### 11.1 Approved copy bank

- Tagline (footer, OG default): **"Conflicts surfaced, not hidden."**
- Hero headline (shipped in scaffold): **"Every layer of what your team knows — one
  effective view."**
- Hero subhead: as in `site/src/pages/index.astro` (keep).
- Problem beats (§4.2), one short paragraph each:
  1. *Scattered* — your team's knowledge lives in repo docs, wikis, and heads; no two
     sources agree on what's current.
  2. *Agents read stale* — an AI agent reading one source gets one layer's truth,
     dated and unattributed.
  3. *Overwriting loses the dissent* — merging docs by replacement destroys the
     minority position you'll need at the next incident.
- How-it-works step names (§4.3): **Stack** (company indigo) / **Resolve** (team teal)
  / **Serve** (personal amber). One sentence each, sourced from README's "layer cake"
  section.

### 11.2 Feature grid (§4.5) — the seven items

| Feature | One-liner source |
|---|---|
| Section-level merge | README "higher layers win — per section" |
| Conflicts carry dates | README `conflicts[]` description |
| Provenance on every section | README `read_file` paragraph (`sourceLayer`, `frontmatterProvenance`) |
| Foreign graphs stitch in | README `layers.json` shape (mcp source → OKF at read time) |
| Write path captures from repos | README "Write path" pipeline |
| Zero dependencies | README Quick start ("plain Node.js ≥ 18") + /install page framing |
| Playground | `playground/README.md` intro |

### 11.3 "For agents" section (§4.6) — real payload

The MCP tool table is README's four-row table verbatim. The JSON sample MUST be real
output of:

```bash
node resolver.mjs --manifest playground/manifest.json --concept decisions/primary-db
```

Truncate `content` strings for display; never alter structure. Shape (verified):

```jsonc
{
  "id": "decisions/primary-db",
  "contributors": [{ "layer": "personal", "level": 3, "updated": "2026-06-28" }, …],
  "frontmatter": { "type": "decision", "title": "Primary database", … },
  "frontmatterProvenance": { "type": "personal", "title": "personal", … },
  "sections": [
    { "key": "choice", "heading": "## Choice {#choice}", "content": "…",
      "sourceLayer": "personal", "sourceUpdated": "2026-06-28",
      "conflicts": [{ "layer": "company", "updated": "2026-05-01", "content": "…" }] },
    …
  ]
}
```

(`suppressed: true` sections exist in the wild — renderers must skip them.)

### 11.4 Demo-data seam (`site/scripts/build-demo-data.mjs`) — contract

1. Read `playground/manifest.json` (paths are relative to the manifest file).
2. Enumerate concept IDs: for each layer path, glob `**/*.md`; the concept ID is the
   relative path minus `.md`. Union across layers. Current demo yields exactly:
   `decisions/primary-db` (3 layers), `interfaces/auth-tokens` (2),
   `runbooks/incident-response` (company only), `runbooks/deploy` (team only).
3. Resolve each ID (shell out to `resolver.mjs`, or import `resolveConcept` — read-only
   import of engine code is allowed; modifying engine files is not).
4. Emit `site/src/data/demo-cascade.json`: `{ "concepts": [ <resolved objects> ] }`.
   The directory is gitignored — this file is generated, never committed, never
   hand-edited. Wire as the site `prebuild` npm script.

### 11.5 Hero visual (§4.1) & /demo — storyboard and constraints

Band anatomy: a leading layer-colored **swatch** (a small rounded square) before the
section heading — *not* a side-stripe border (amended 2026-07-03 after the design
critique flagged `border-left` accents; the swatch reads as a legend key and keeps the
deterministic detector clean); mono section heading; provenance right-aligned
(`layer · date`); conflict chip in `--cc-conflict` on conflicted bands.

Phase-5 animation storyboard: (1) three layer planes stacked in precedence order, each
a card in its layer color; (2) a concept present on multiple layers highlights as a
vertical column through the planes; (3) the column resolves into ONE banded composite —
staggered band reveal, each band striped to its source layer, provenance labels visible
from the first frame.

Hard constraints (from the reviewed prototype — violations were specifically flagged):
- NEVER collapse to a single unstriped node (teaches whole-doc winner-takes-all — wrong).
- Provenance visible by default, not behind a click.
- Persona/viewer switching is a selector, not a linear "peel" (layer membership is a DAG).
- `prefers-reduced-motion`: render the final composite statically, skip all motion.

Reference implementation: **`specs/contextcake-site/assets/cascade-viz-prototype.html`**
(self-contained, no CDN, open directly in a browser) — implements the banded composite +
persona selector against the real `primary-db` fixture. Vendored from the 2026-06-24
brainstorm; treat as a working sketch to steal logic from, not code to ship.

### 11.6 Phase → acceptance-criteria traceability (definition of done)

| Phase | Done when (spec.md §Acceptance Criteria) |
|---|---|
| 3 — Homepage | Homepage AC 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 (AC 3 in its static form) + all Site-wide ACs; `npm run build` exits 0 |
| 4 — Docs port | All Docs ACs; every §5 page's TODO(agent) marker gone; `/doc-reviewer` pass clean |
| 5 — Animation + /demo | Homepage AC 3 (animated), demo-data ACs (real resolver output), /demo page live |
| 6 — Launch pass | OG images, a11y (4.5:1, focus, reduced-motion), responsive 375/768/1024/1440, zero broken links |

Every phase ends the same way: run the §10 self-verification and paste the result.
